The problem is even worse when we have a multi-class problem. If we have 10 classes and only 20 examples, It leaves us with only 2 examples for each class on average.

For the multi-class problem, we get 10 examples for each class on average, and it’s much better than just 2. After we evaluated our learning algorithm.we are now can train our model on all our data because if our 5 models had similar performance using different train sets, we assume that by training it on all the data will get similar performance.By doing cross-validation(that is by increasing the number of iterations), we’re able to use all our 100 examples both for training and for testing while evaluating our learning algorithm on examples it has never seen before. ***\n",
